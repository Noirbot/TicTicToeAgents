This program can be run from command line by going to the source folder and running

“ruby GameDriver.rb”

Followed by the appropriate arguments. 

Providing invalid arguments, or no arguments at all will cause it to print a helpful list of instructions for use, which are duplicated below:

There are 4 arguments that can be given, of which three are mandatory: AgentX, AgentO, NumGames, and Silent.

•	AgentX – Valid values are “smart” and “random”
•	AgentO – Valid values are “smart” and “random”
•	NumGames – Valid values are any integer between 1 and pretty much as big as you want.
•	Silent – You get to add the optional flag “--silent”. Without this, you get a LOT of output. You really want to only disable this for just a few games.
